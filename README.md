# Skizze

Skizze is a modular Python pipeline that converts images to clean line drawings.
On first run it creates a virtual environment and installs any missing
dependencies automatically. The toolkit supports classic OpenCV as well as
DeepLSD (ONNX) and Fâ€‘Clip (PyTorch).

```bash
# quick start
python Skizze.py --input path/to/image.jpg --output-dir results
```

See the documentation in the specification for full details.
